# üå± IoT-based UGV Robot for Remote Soil Health Sensing
This project details the development of an **Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV)** for the remote collection of agricultural data, with the goal of enhancing **precision agriculture**.  

The UGV is designed to collect **environmental and soil health parameters** and can operate **remotely or autonomously**. It sends real-time data to a **Base Station** and stores it for future analysis.
---
## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
The system consists of **three main components**:
### 1. Chassis Control System (UGV)
- The UGV's main control system is managed by a **Raspberry Pi (B1)**.  
- This single-board computer handles remote operations via a **WiFi Module (B3)**, which enables communication with the **Computer Client** for remote control.  
- The UGV's core is a Raspberry Pi.  
- The **Freenove software** provides built-in functionality for remote control over Wi-Fi through a computer client.  
- The Raspberry Pi manages this remote operation.  
---
### 2. Sensor Collection Module
- Integrated into the UGV's chassis and controlled by an **Arduino Nano (A1)**.  
- Acts as the central hub for data acquisition, collecting data from various sensors including:  
  - **Sensors (A2):** Humidity, Temperature, Soil Moisture  
  - **NPK Sensor:** Measures Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K)  
  - **GPS Module:** Provides real-time GPS coordinates of the UGV  
- An **NRF24 Transmitter (A3)** sends the collected sensor data, including NPK and GPS values, to the Base Station.  
---
### 3. Base Station
- The Base Station receives and processes the data transmitted by the UGV.  
- An **NRF24 Receiver (C1)** receives data from the UGV's transmitter.  
- The data is then:  
  - **Visualized** on a dashboard using **Matplotlib (C2)**  
  - **Archived** in CSV files (**C3**) for future reference and analysis  
---
### 4. Computer Client
- Serves as the **remote control interface (D1)**.  
- Enables a user to control the UGV via WiFi communication.  
---
## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Autonomous Navigation**: GPS-based path planning to reach predefined coordinates.  
- **Remote Control**: WiFi client interface for manual operation.  
- **Real-Time Data Collection**: Soil and environmental parameters including NPK values.  
- **Data Visualization**: Real-time dashboard for monitoring soil health.  
- **Data Storage**: Data archived in CSV for later research and analysis.  
- **Scalability**: Architecture allows additional sensors or communication modules to be integrated.  
- **Modular Design**: Independent modules (UGV, sensors, base station) make upgrades simple.  
- **Open-Source Friendly**: Uses Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Python libraries for easy reproducibility.
