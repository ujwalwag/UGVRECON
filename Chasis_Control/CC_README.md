The Freenove Raspberry Pi Car Kit provides a comprehensive platform for building and programming a robot car. The kit includes a robot chassis and various electronic components, such as a camera, servo motors, and a motor driver board. The primary software for controlling the car is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi, which acts as the central processing unit.

The software's key feature is its ability to be controlled wirelessly over Wi-Fi. This functionality is a major part of the kit's design, allowing users to remotely operate the car from a computer, an Android device, or an iPhone. The provided software includes server-side code that runs on the Raspberry Pi and client-side applications for the remote device.

The Freenove kit's software offers several built-in functionalities:

Wireless Control: The software facilitates remote control of the carâ€™s movement, including forward, backward, left, and right, by sending commands from the client to the robot over Wi-Fi.

Camera and Video Streaming: The software enables video streaming from the robot's camera to the client device, allowing for a real-time view of the surroundings.

Control over Other Features: Beyond basic movement, the software can control other features such as obstacle avoidance and line tracking.

The software is open-source and comes with a detailed tutorial that guides users through the assembly and programming process. This allows for customization and modification to add new features or integrate the robot car into larger projects.
